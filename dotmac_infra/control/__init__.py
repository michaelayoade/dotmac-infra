Operations Plane SDKs

The orchestration and automation layer that coordinates complex business processes
across all domain planes with strict DRY principles and SDK-to-SDK composition.

Core SDKs:
- Job Queue SDK: Background processing foundation
- Task Scheduler SDK: Time-based automation (cron, delays, rrule)
- Workflow Engine SDK: Complex multi-step business process orchestration
- State Machine SDK: Finite state machine management
- Automation Engine SDK: Rule-based business automation
- Saga Orchestration SDK: Distributed transaction management
- Retry & Circuit Breaker SDK: Fault tolerance patterns
- Lock Management SDK: Distributed locking and concurrency
- Batch Processing SDK: Large-scale data operations
